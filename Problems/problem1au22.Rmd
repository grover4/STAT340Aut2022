### Exercises 

1. For each of the following experiments, describe the sample space $S$.

    a. Count the number of insect-damaged leaves on a plant.
	 
    b. Observe the proportion of defectives in a shipment of $N$ electronic components. 
	

2. Suppose a person is randomly selected from a large city. Let $A$ be the event that the randomly selected person is male, $B$ the event that the person is under 30 and $C$ that the person speaks French. Write the following verbal description of events using set operations on $A$, $B$, $C$. Venn diagrams might help you to figure out answers to this.  

    a. A male at least 30 years old
	
    b. A female under 30 who speaks French
	
    c. A male who is either under 30 or speaks French


3.  Winthrop,a pre-med student, has been summarily rejected by all 126 US medical schools. Desperate,
he sends his transcripts and MCATs to the two least selective foreign schools he can think
of, the two branch campuses (N and E ) of Swampwater Tech. Based on the success his friends have had there,
he estimates that his probability of being accepted at E is 0.7, and at
N, 0.4. He also suspects there is a 75% chance that at least one of his applications
will be rejected. What is the probability that at least one of the schools will accept him?

    Hint: Let $E$ denote the event that he is accepted at the eastern branch and $N$ the event that he is accepted at the Northern branch. 

    You are given $$P(E) = 0.7, P(N) = 0.4, P(E^c \cup N^c) = 0.75.$$ 

    You need to find $P(E \cup N).$

4. (Subset inequality) Prove that if $E \subset F$, then $P(E) \leq P(F)$.   (Hint: Write $F$ as the union of two mutually exclusive sets $E$ and $F - E$. )
