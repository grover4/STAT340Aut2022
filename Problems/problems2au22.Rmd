### Exercises 

1.  (*Lady Tasting Tea*) In a famous experiment conducted by Sir. R. A. Fisher, 8 cups of tea - 4 prepared by pouring the milk first and then the tea and 4 prepared by pouring the tea first and then the milk -- were  presented in random order to Muriel Bristol who claimed she could tell the difference. 

The methods employed in the experiment were fully disclosed to the subject and she had to select the 4 cups prepared with the "milk poured first". 


```{r tea-cups, echo=F, fig.align = "center", out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("problem2au22fig1.JPG")
```

  Assume the lady possesses no extra sensory powers and is just selecting a subset of 4 cups randomly from eight.
  
  a. The sample space $S$ for this experiment consists of all groupings of 4 cups selected from eight. How many such groups are there? Write your answer symbolically first and also calculate it in the code chunk below.
  
```{r sample-space}
#calculate number of elements in S
## in the code chunk below

```
  
  b. Let $E$ denote the event that there are 3 cups with "milk poured first" and 1 cup with "tea poured first". How many elements are in $E$? Write your answer symbolically first and also calculate it in a code chunk below.

 c. Assuming that every outcome in $S$ is equally likely, calculate $P(E)$. You may do this in a code chunk.

2. One useful application of conditional probabilities is in calculating inverse probabilities. For example,
consider the following tree diagram of probabilities relating a screening test for a disease with the actual presence of disease. 


```{r treediagram, echo = FALSE}

treeDiag(main = c("Disease status", "Test result"),
         p1 = c(0.001, 0.999),
         p2 = list(c(0.98, "?"), c("?", 0.99)),
         out1 = c("Present", "Absent"),
         out2 = c("Positive", "Negative"),
         showSol = FALSE,
         showWork = TRUE,
         solwd = 0.5,
         digits = 6)

```

Let $D$ denote that a randomly selected individual has the disease, and $T$ the event that the screening test is positive. 

The first (primary) branch of the tree gives \emph{unconditional} probabilities of disease being present or absent:
$$P(D) = 0.001, P(D^{c}) = 0.999$$ 

while the secondary branches state conditional probabilities of the test coming out positive given the disease status:

$$P(T|D) = 0.98, P(T|D^{c}) = 0.99.$$

The conditional probabilities are called the \emph{sensitivity} and \emph{specificity} of the test respectively. \

   a. Fill in the values in the tree diagram for the conditional probabilities $P(T^{c}|D)$ and $P(T^{c}|D^{c})$ indicated by a "?"  (Hint: conditional probability follows Law of Complements.)

   b. Set `showSol = TRUE` in the `treeDiag` function and look at the output. What events do the probabilities at the end of each branch correspond to? Write them symbolically below.

   c. Suppose the test is positive. What is the probability that the person actually has disease? In other words, find: 
$$P(D|T) = \frac{P(D \cap T)}{P(T)}.$$

  Hint for calculating the denominator: the event, $T$, that the test is positive is the union of two mutually exclusive events: $T = ( T \cap D ) \cup (T \cap D^{c})$

   d. The probability you calculated in part c. is an inverse conditional probability and is referred to as the \emph{positive predictive value} of the screening test. Comment on why it makes sense for this number to be so small in this example. 

   e. Now calculate the inverse conditional probability $P(D^{c}|T^{c})$. 


3. Suppose that string of tree lights you just bought has twenty-four bulbs
wired in series. If each bulb has a 99.9% chance of “working” when the current
is applied, what is the probability that the string itself will not work? You may assume that bulb failures are independent.
