### Exercises 
	 
1. Suppose you toss a fair coin 3 times. The sample space for this experiment is shown below:
$$S = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, TTT,TTH, THT, THH \}.$$

a. Write the PMF of $X$ defined as the difference between number of heads and number of tails.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
$x$ & -3 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\ \hline
$f(x)$ & 1/8 & 3/8 & 3/8 & 1/8 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

b. Give the CDF of $X$.

\begin{align*} 
F(x) &= P(X\leq x) \\ 
&= \left \{ 
\begin{array}{cc}
                0 &\text{ if }  x < -3 \\ \\
      \frac{1}{8} &\text{ if } -3 \leq x < -1 \\ \\
      \frac{4}{8} &\text{ if } -1 \leq x < 1 \\ \\
      \frac{7}{8} &\text{ if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\ \\
                1 &\text{ if } x \geq 3
\end{array} \right.
\end{align*}

c. Draw the probability histogram of $X$ in R.

2. Suppose $X$ is a discrete uniform random variable on the integers $-n, -n + 1, -n +2, \dots, 0, 1, 2,\dots, n$, that is, 
$$f(x) = P(X = x) = c, \ \ \ x = -n, -n+1, -n+2, \dots, 1,2,\dots,n.$$

a. What is $c$?

b. What is the PMF of  $$Y = -X? $$
